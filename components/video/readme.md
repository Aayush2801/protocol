A responsive container for embedded video. The video is scaled to the width
of its container and maintains its aspect ratio. It has no specific dimensions
of its own so itâ€™s best used inside another component.

- Supports either inline video with the HTML5 `<video>` element or an
  `<iframe>` for services like YouTube.
- Supports either a 16:9 aspect ratio (the default) or a 4:3 aspect ratio with
  an additional class: `mzp-has-aspect-4-3`
